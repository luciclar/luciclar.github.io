    "section": "",
    "text": "Spatio-temporal data are prevalent in many applications within modern ecology and climate science . Statistical modeling of such data presents a significant challenge, historically focusing on Gaussian random fields (GRFs) and kriging for prediction . In a seminal paper, Lindgren et al. (2011) proposed an inference methodology based on the fact that certain GRFs can be expressed as solutions to stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). The most famous example is the spatial Matérn GRFs, which are solutions to the diffusion-type equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n(\\kappa^2-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2} u = \\mathcal{W},\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{W}\\) is a stochastic forcing term (e.g., white noise), and \\(\\theta = (\\kappa, \\alpha)\\) are the model parameters, related to the Matérn covariance function. This approach bridges the gap between physical and statistical modeling, leading to a wealth of research refining the Equation above to model a broader class of random fields, and developing statistical inference procedures to estimate the model parameters . Most of these methods rely on a mesh-based approach, using finite elements or volumes to discretize the equation over a finite set of basis functions. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs, Raissi et al., 2019) have recently been introduced to solve partial differential equations \\(\\mathcal{N}[u] = 0\\), where \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) is an arbitrary differential operator. The goal is to find the best neural network \\(u_\\nu\\) representing the solution by minimizing its PDE residuals computed at randomly sampled collocation points. This mesh-free approach has proven useful in various contexts and can be extended to inverse problems where the objective is to learn the parameters \\(\\theta\\) of the differential operator from certain observations of the solution.\nThis work aims to generalize the PINN approach to solve SPDEs. To do so, several modifications to the deterministic framework are necessary and will need to be explored. First, the neural network must represent a stochastic process, which can be achieved through generative modeling where the network \\(u_\\nu(Z)\\) has an additional latent variable \\(Z\\sim \\mathbb{Q}\\) as input. The quantity of interest then becomes the distribution \\(\\mathbb{P}_\\nu\\) of the network’s SPDE residuals \\(\\mathcal{N}[u_\\nu](Z)\\). This can be interpreted as a generative model, where \\(\\mathbb{P}_\\nu := \\mathcal{N}[u_\\nu](\\cdot) \\# \\mathbb{Q}\\) is the pushforward of the base distribution of \\(Z\\) through the PINN.\nSecond, it is necessary to define an appropriate loss function that accounts for the stochastic nature of the objects involved. Since SPDEs prescribe equality in distribution, a natural choice is to consider a measure of similarity between the probability distributions \\(D(\\mathbb{P}_\\nu, \\mathcal{W})\\). Several options are possible, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence, pp-Wasserstein distance as in Arjovsky et al. (2017), or maximum mean discrepancy associated with a certain reproducing kernel (Gretton et al., 2012), each leading to different learning strategies for the network parameters νν.\nStarting from the Equation above, the goal is to explore and implement the various methodologies discussed above."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As part of a collaboration with Thomas Romary and Mike Pereira (Mines Paris), we proposed an Master1-level internship (three months) focused on parameter estimation for spatio-temporal models using graph neural networks. The internship was funded by the [_Geolearning_] chair and took place from June to August 2023 with Vincent Fourmigué, a student at AgroParisTech. Although the student was employed by Mines Paris, he spent nearly the entire internship at the UMR MIA Paris-Saclay facilities on the Agro Paris Saclay Campus.\nIn geostatistics, Gaussian processes are commonly used to model spatial and spatio-temporal data because they allow for straightforward prediction of the variable of interest at unmeasured sites while quantifying the uncertainty of the prediction. In this context, the data are considered to be a realization of a Gaussian random field, whose covariance function needs to be estimated from the data. A classical approach for inference is to select a parameterized family of covariance functions and then choose the parameters that maximize the likelihood associated with the data. In practice, this approach often becomes a bottleneck, as even evaluating the likelihood function can quickly become computationally expensive when dealing with large amounts of data, especially in spatio-temporal settings. Therefore, it is desirable to have methods that allow for deducing the parameters of a covariance model without relying on the likelihood function.\nRecently, several methods using neural networks (notably CNNs and GNNs) have been proposed to address this issue. The main approach aims to train a neural network capable of identifying the parameters of a covariance function based on a realization of a Gaussian random field with that covariance (Gerber et al., 2022, Lenzi et al., 2023, Wikle et al., 2022, Sainsbury-Dale et al., 2023).\nThis internship aimed to develop and validate an architecture adapted to the spatio-temporal context. One challenge of this generalization is the estimation of a larger number of parameters, which has not been implemented so far. The first step involved coding (using the **PyGeometric** library in Python) the strategy highlighted in the literature, initially on simulated datasets. In the second phase, the goal was to adapt this approach to the spatio-temporal case, particularly for models derived from stochastic partial differential equations (Clarotto et al., 2024)."
